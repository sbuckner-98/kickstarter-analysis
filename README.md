# An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns 
Uncovering data on theater-related Kickstarters to determine efficacy and strategies for success.

## An overview of the findings

Good news for individuals and organizations launching theater Kickstarters in the United States: Our research found a 57.5% success rate of the over 900 we studied, dating back as far as 2009. For plays in particular, the numbrs were even more promising. Over 61% of the 671 Kickstarters for plays that we studied were successful. With these numbers in mind, and the analysis carried out, we are confident that with proper planning a theater Kickstarter can be successful.

## Recommendations

Not all of these Kickstarters were created equal, however, and our analysis found that certain characteristics made Kickstarters more likely to succeed in obtaining their funding targets.

1. Launch Date
Our first suggestion pertains to the time of year the Kickstarter is launched. As pictured below, American theater Kickstarters experience much higher success rates overall when launched in the summer months, especially May and June. In contrast, Kickstarters launched in the winter were much more likely to fail to meet their goals. **As such, we would suggest launching a theater Kickstarter in May.**

2. Setting Goals
Our second suggestion pertains to setting funding targets and expectations on donation amounts. The data demonstrate a sizeable difference in funding goals between successful and failed American theater Kickstarter campaigns. Namely, the mean goal for a successful campaign was $5,048, while the mean goal for a failed campaign was $10,554 -- nearly double. Median goals, which are less influenced by outlier campaigns (in this case, those with much higher goals than an ordianry campaign) reflected a similar story: successful campagins had a median goal of $3,000, while failed campaigns had a median goal of $5,000. **With this in mind, based on the data we would encourage setting a funding goal for a theater Kickstarter campaign between $3,000 and $5,000 dollars.** 

In terms of donations, the data found successful campaigns saw an average donation of $92.76. We would suggest creating tiers of support and benefits with this number in mind.
